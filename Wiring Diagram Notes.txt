Please note that the wiring diagram here is for hookup purposes only.
Safe power management has been ommitted for clairity. (Capacitors, resistor values, voltage regulation system)

Other Notes:
------------
Vss: Voltage System Source. 
  Connected directly from the system voltage source to the transmitter.
  Bypasses the regulator systems as RF Transmitters can dramatically change current requirements, and may
   cause current spikes or brownouts in systems with poor power management. WRL-10534 in example accepts 5-12V.

Vdd: Voltage, Secondary Source.
  A separate voltage source is recommended.
  For chip- or linearly-controlled relay boards, it is a good practice to separate the power sources for the 
   relay and the board/controller, to limit the risk of power spikes or voltage ringing.

+5V: Connected through the Arduino 5V Regulator or through an external 5V source.
  Total recommended power draw through the 5V line on the Arduino Uno is 500mA, with 800mA being the 
    maximum recommed limit. Maximum current draw in example is estimated to be <30mA for the Hub Node, 
    and ~50mA maximum for for the Leaf Nodes.

Leaf: Pin 7: Relay Signal Pin.
  Please be sure that the relay controller/driver you are using AND the indicator LED use a total of less than
    30mA. The Uno is rated for 40mA maximum on a single pin.
  If you are using a non-isolated relay, or one that requires a larger amount of current to toggle, a 
    secondary driver, such as a MOSFET, is highly recommended.
